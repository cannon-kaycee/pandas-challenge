Conclusion 1: When looking at the top five and bottom five schools by the percent of students passing both math and reading, it shows that a higher budget per school does not necessarily mean that the students perform better. Two of the highest school budgets are also in the bottom 5 performing schools.

Conclusion 2: There seems to be a trend in the performance rates between districts and charter schools. We see this in the fact that the top five schools are all charter schools, and the bottom five schools are all districts. We also see this in fact that charter schools have 90% overall passing scores and districts have 53%.

Conclusion 3: The data that combines math and reading scores by school size show a trend that percentage of students who are passing math and reading is higher in schools with fewer students.
